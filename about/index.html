        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This website aims to make it easier to search for scheduled train services. The data that powers this is provided <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/data-feeds/terms-and-conditions/">under license</a> by <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/">network rail</a>.
            <br />
            You can access this website on PC/Tablet/Mobile. The website is optimised to work on all devices.
            <br />
            This website is run in my own spare time and as such I cannot devote 100% of time to it. If there are problems it may take a while to fix, although I would aim to resolve major issues pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>
            From the home page you can search for trains:
            <ul>
                <li>Starting From: a location</li>
                <li>Calling From: a location, To: a location (Direct Services Only)</li>
                <li>To: a location (terminate at location)</li>
                <li>At: a location (call at location en route)</li>
            </ul>
            You can use the "Local" links to lookup stations near to your current location (if permission is granted).
            <br />
            You can also search for the nearest train to you (useful if on the move). This looks up your current location (if permission is granted) and will look for trains that have passed your location in the recent past.
        </p>
        <h3>Search Results</h3>
        <p>
            From the home page search you are presented with a list of matching trains. You can navigate backwards and forwards in time and then click through to a train in more details.<br />
            Search Results by default hide trains identified as "TOC-ZZ" (Mainly freight), passing trains and Empty Coaching Stock (ECS) trains. You can show these by clicking the "Advanced" option in the top menu bar.
        </p>
        <h3>Train Details</h3>
        <p>
            From the search results page, clicking on a Train Identifier gives you a tabbed layout of train details:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Train</strong> - lists the planned schedule with current running information included</li>
                <li><strong>Schedule</strong> - lists the planned schedule for the train</li>
                <li><strong>Live</strong> - lists the current running information only</li>
                <li><strong>Details</strong> - lists details about the train, such as operator and type</li>
                <li><strong>Map</strong> - provides a map of planned calling points for this train</li>
            </ul>
            If you click the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> icon above to activate live tracking then the page will update in real-time with the current data.<br />
            Passing stops are hidden by default. You can show these by clicking the "Advanced" option in the top menu bar.
        </p>
        <h3>Live </h3>
        <p>
            There are a number of live data pages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Routes</strong> - This provides live (10 second updates) of train locations on some local routes in the west midlands.</li>
                <li><strong>Stations</strong> - This attempts to provide live (10 second updates) of train locations at Birmingham New Street.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>PPM</h3>
        <p>
            This page provides live (60 second updates) PPM (Public Performance Measure) data of all train operators in the UK. Planned updates include providing historical data lookup
        </p>

            Related projects
        </h2>
        <p>
            I also run two other projects based off the data this site generates:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.traindelay.co.uk">traindelay.co.uk</a> - simple interface to see how late your train was</li>
                <li><a href="https://twitter.com/fivewaysearly">twitter.com/fivewaysearly</a> -  a twitter account that tweets whenever a <a href="http://www.londonmidland.com/">London Midland</a> train leaves <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/fwy/details.html">Five Ways station</a> early</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Updates
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are a variety of features planned including:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) applications - for now the website will perform perfectly adequately on mobile devices
                </li>
                <li>Google Chrome browser apps/extensions</li>
                <li>Historical PPM Data - the data is stored on the server but currently inacessible to view on the website</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>04/11/2014</h3>
        <p>
            Site is now hosted on GitHub Pages
        </p>
        <h3>15/02/2014</h3>
        <p>
            Stations page now replaced with link to <a href="http://www.whattrain.co.uk" target="_blank">whattrain.co.uk</a> website.
        </p>
        <h3>12/02/2014</h3>
        <p>
            Trains starting from a location may now show an arrival time, this is the time and platform (if known), the train arrived at the departure platform. This can be calculated automatically in some cases, for other stations this needs to be calculated manually so is a work in progress.
        </p>
        <h3>09/02/2014</h3>
        <p>
            Realtime running information should be more accurate in a lot of places, usually to the second due to matching against the TD Feed. Data is recorded against the TRUST record, accurate to the minute, and then if possible updated to the second by the TD feed.<br />
            This is not available in all areas as the reference data is not complete. Further improvements will be made as time goes on.
        </p>
        <h2>Accuracy and reliability</h2>
        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>
            Some trains can sometimes be missing data, this is often due to the fact the train did not run or did not report properly to the supplied data feed by network rail. Other times it can be do with errors with this website or its associated server side components.
        </p>
        <h3>Server</h3>
        <p>
            This website is hosted via GitHub Pages and the associated server side components that power it are hosted on a Microsoft Azure Server, which should be pretty reliable.
        </p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>

            This website and server side componenents are open source and the code for this website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/blueghostuk/trainnotifier-webclient">github</a>.
